STOCK PRICE PREDICTION USING LSTM AND TIME SERIES ANALYSIS: 
Engineered a predictive model for TATA Power by integrating ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM models to forecast stock prices and identify market trends. Leveraged LSTM to predict stock prices for the next 30 days, ensuring high accuracy and robust performance by benchmarking against traditional models such as linear regression and random forest.
